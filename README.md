# Sales Proposal Process Optimization

## Description
This project focuses on optimizing the **Sales Proposal Process** for Gentech by reducing cycle time, minimizing defects, and enhancing efficiency. Using the **DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control)** framework, the project identifies inefficiencies, proposes process improvements, and implements control mechanisms to ensure sustainable results. It includes detailed analyses, process maps, and key metrics like DPMO and Sigma levels to measure performance and outcomes.

## Overview
The Sales Proposal Process Optimization project addresses inefficiencies in the sales proposal cycle, particularly focusing on:
- Reducing proposal cycle time.
- Increasing SLA compliance.
- Enhancing overall process efficiency.
  
The project follows the **Six Sigma DMAIC methodology** to deliver actionable recommendations and ensure measurable outcomes.

---

## Objectives
- **Efficiency Gains**:
  - Decrease the average proposal cycle time.
  - Reduce rework by 30%, minimizing hand-offs and delays.
- **Revenue Recovery**:
  - Reduce drop-offs due to delays.
  - Identify regional benchmarks to enhance revenue recapture.

## Process Maps
The repository includes:
- **Current Process Map**: A swim lane diagram of the existing process, highlighting pain points.
- **Improved Process Map**: A proposed streamlined process after optimization.

---

## Analysis
- **Key Tools Used**:
  - Pareto Charts: To identify high-impact delays.
  - Fishbone Diagram: To analyze root causes.
  - FMEA Analysis: To assess risks and prioritize improvements.
- **Key Findings**:
  - ZQT6 and ZQT8 are the most critical steps with significant delays.
  - Rework and missing information were primary contributors to inefficiencies.

---

## Key Metrics
- **DPMO (Defects per Million Opportunities)**: 281,053 defects, indicating significant inefficiencies.
- **Sigma Level**: 2.079, highlighting high variability in process performance.
- **Hand-Off Reduction**: Metrics to measure the impact of rework minimization.
- **SLA Compliance Percentage**: Improvements in timely proposal generation.

---

## Improvements
The project proposes:
1. **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** to ensure consistent process execution.
2. **Error-Proofing Mechanisms** to reduce defects and minimize rework.
3. **Training Programs** for Bid Support Specialists (BSS) to enhance skillsets.
4. **Checklists for BSS** to ensure thorough and accurate proposals.

---

## Control Measures
To sustain improvements:
1. **SPC Tools**: Control charts and compliance scorecards to monitor metrics.
2. **Feedback Loops**: Monthly reviews of process adherence and outcomes.
3. **Benchmarking**: Regional comparison to identify areas of excellence and opportunities.

## Results
The project achieved:
1. A 30% reduction in rework and hand-offs.
2. 20% growth in proposal conversion rates.
3. 25% revenue recovery through better SLA compliance and streamlined processes
